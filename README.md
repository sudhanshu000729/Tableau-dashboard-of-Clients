Using the provided [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vFlZU8vKqhhIdF6IbiYM1svP8VepUpjx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107124499010616303016&rtpof=true&sd=true) containing information about various products,
clients, outstanding balances, and reporting dates, create a Tableau
dashboard that answers the following questions:
1) What is the distribution of outstanding balances across different interest rates?
2) Can you identify any correlation between the interest rates and the balance
outstanding?
3) Create a visualization that highlights the top 5 clients with the highest outstanding
balances over time. Allow users to filter by the reporting date.
